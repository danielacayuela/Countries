# Countries

This site is under construction. I am working on making it responsive and its deployment.

Inside the project I included JS, ReactJS, ReduxJS, NodeJS, Express, Sequelize - Postgres, and Styled Components.

The external api restcountries.eu was used for the project.

It starts with the landing page where you are redirected to Home. From there, you can browse all the available countries. Ten countries per page.

You can filter by continent, by population (from ascending to descending, and vice versa), and by name (from A to Z, and the other way).

You also can look for a country by its name or those that include the searched word.

By clicking on the country detail, you can view the country's general information: name, code, continent, sub-region, capital, number of inhabitants, area and the activities you have created for it.

From the activity option, you can create different activities for different countries. You can select more than one country at the same time.

To create it, you must give it a name, select the difficulty from 1 to 5, the time in hours from 1 to 10, the season of the year and the countries to which you want the activity to be included.

Once you have done this, when you return to the detail of the selected countries, you will find the created activity.

To start the project: clone the repository, in the api and client folders run npm install , and then npm start in each one.
